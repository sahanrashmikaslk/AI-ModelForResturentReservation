# To create an AI model for predicting high head count and most demanding table based on generated dummy data for a resturent reservation system

- In this project, we generated a dummy dataset for reservation data, preprocessed the data, trained a machine learning model to predict head count and demamding table at a given time, evaluated the model's performance, and created a Flask API to serve the model for making predictions. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model and deploying it as a web service using Flask.

- The project includes the following steps:

1. Generate a dummy dataset for reservation data
2. Preprocess the data
3. Train a machine learning model to predict head count
4. Evaluate the model's performance
5. Create a Flask API to serve the model for making predictions
